Make a simulation of two groups (N=10 per group) drawn from the same population with the following parameters: mean=40 and sd=10

#1) Use the CLT to find the probability of observing a difference of 4 or more between the two groups (either positive or negative), by chance.
```{r}

```

#2) Calculate the same probability using the randomization test.
```{r}

```

#3) Given the similarity of the two probabilities, what is the biggest advantage of using the randomization test?
```{r}

```

#4) While keeping everything else fixed, what happens to those probabilities if we increase the number of subjects (N) from 10 to 1000 â€“ and why? (no need to provide the code, just write what happens and the reason you think behind this effect)
```{r}

```
